        <div class="info-grid">
          <div class="info-block">
            <h4>Amortized loan – fixed payments</h4>
            <p>
              This is the “normal” loan most people know. You make a regular
              payment each month (or week, etc.). Every payment includes some
              interest and some repayment of the amount you borrowed. Over time,
              the loan slowly shrinks until it is fully paid off.
            </p>
            <p class="info-list-title">Common examples:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Home loans (mortgages)</li>
              <li>Car loans</li>
              <li>Personal loans with monthly payments</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              In the calculator, choose <strong>“Amortized loan”</strong> if you
              want to see how big your regular payment is and how much total
              interest you will pay.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="info-block">
            <h4>Deferred payment loan – one big payment at the end</h4>
            <p>
              With this type of loan you don’t make regular payments. Instead,
              interest builds up over the life of the loan and you pay
              <strong>everything in one lump sum</strong> at the end.
            </p>
            <p class="info-list-title">You might see this in:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Some short-term business loans</li>
              <li>“Balloon” loans where most of the amount is due at the end</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              In the calculator, choose
              <strong>“Deferred payment loan”</strong> to see how large that
              final payment will be and how much interest builds up.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="info-block">
            <h4>Bond – amount you get today vs. amount you pay back later</h4>
            <p>
              A bond is a type of loan usually used by governments or companies.
              You agree to pay back a fixed amount in the future, and in return
              you receive some money today (usually a smaller amount).
            </p>
            <p class="info-list-title">This calculator helps you:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Work out how much you receive today for a future payoff</li>
              <li>See how much of the difference is effectively interest</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              In the calculator, choose <strong>“Bond”</strong> and enter the
              amount that must be paid back at maturity as the
              <strong>Predetermined Due Amount</strong>.
            </p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <h3 class="info-title basics-title">Loan basics in plain language</h3>

        <div class="info-grid basics-grid">
          <div class="info-block small">
            <h4>Interest rate</h4>
            <p>
              The interest rate is the “price” of borrowing money. A higher
              rate means you pay more over time. Even small differences in the
              rate can add up to a lot of money on long loans.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="info-block small">
            <h4>Compounding</h4>
            <p>
              Compounding means interest is added to your balance, and then
              new interest is charged on that higher amount. The more often it
              compounds (daily vs. yearly), the more you will pay in total.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="info-block small">
            <h4>Loan term</h4>
            <p>
              The term is how long the loan lasts. A longer term usually means
              smaller regular payments, but more interest paid overall. A
              shorter term means higher payments but less total interest.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="info-block small">
            <h4>Secured vs. unsecured</h4>
            <p>
              A secured loan is backed by something you own, like a house or a
              car. If you don’t pay, the lender can take that asset. Unsecured
              loans (like many personal loans or credit cards) have no
              collateral, so they often come with higher interest rates.
