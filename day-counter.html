          <h4>Days between two dates</h4>
          <p>
            Choose a start date and an end date, then press <strong>“Calculate days”</strong>.
            We count how many full days are in between and split them into weekdays
            (Monday to Friday) and weekend days (Saturday and Sunday).
          </p>
          <p>
            Turn on <strong>“Include end day”</strong> if you want the last date to be counted as well.
            For example, for a project due on a certain day, you may want to include that day.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="info-block">
          <h4>Count days from a date</h4>
          <p>
            Pick a starting date and choose how many days to add or subtract. The calculator
            will show you what date you land on and which day of the week it is.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you only care about working days, tick
            <strong>“Count business days only”</strong>. In that case we skip Saturdays and Sundays.

        </div>

        <div class="info-block">
          <h4>Typical uses</h4>
          <p>
            People use this kind of day counter to:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Plan deadlines and project schedules</li>
            <li>Count down to events, trips, or birthdays</li>

        <div class="info-block small">
          <h4>Business days</h4>
          <p>
            In this calculator, business days are Monday to Friday. Weekends (Saturday and Sunday)
            are always counted separately and can be skipped in the “business days only” mode.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="info-block small">
          <h4>Holidays</h4>
          <p>
            Different countries and companies follow different holidays. To keep things simple,
            this version of the calculator does not include public holidays yet. In the future,
            we plan to let you mark specific dates as holidays and exclude them from business days.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="info-block small">
          <h4>Start and end days</h4>
          <p>
            The start date is always counted as a full day. The end date is only counted when
            you check the <strong>“Include end day”</strong> box.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="info-block small">
          <h4>Day of the week</h4>
          <p>
            For any result date, we also show the day of the week so you can quickly see whether
            it falls on a weekday or weekend.
